# Driver's App for "Uber"

Specification:

Include the following entities:
Build a RESTful API endpoint that returns a paginated JSON list of rides in descending score order for a given driver
Calculate the score of a ride in $ per hour as: (ride earnings) / (commute duration + ride duration). Higher is better
Google Maps is expensive. Consider how you can reduce duplicate API calls ( assuming time of api call doesn't matter )
Include RSpec tests

Definitions:

The driving distance between two addresses is the distance in miles that it would take to drive a reasonably efficient route between them. It is not the straight line distance. It can be calculated by using a routing service
The driving duration between two addresses is the amount of time in hours it would take to drive the driving distance under realistic driving conditions. It can be calculated by using a routing service
The commute distance for a ride is the driving distance from the driverâ€™s home address to the start of the ride, in miles
The commute duration for a ride is the amount of time it is expected to take to drive the commute distance, in hours.
The ride distance for a ride is the driving distance from the start address of the ride to the destination address, in miles
The ride duration for a ride is the amount of time it is expected to take to drive the ride distance, in hours
The ride earnings is how much the driver earns by driving the ride. It takes into account both the amount of time the ride is expected to take and the distance. For the purposes of this exercise, it is calculated as: $12 + $1.50 per mile beyond 5 miles + (ride duration) * $0.70 per minute beyond 15 minutes
